### Python Code Execution Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Change directory to the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/local/repository
     ```
   Replace `cd path/to/your/local/repository` with the actual path where your repository is located.

3. **Run the bat**
   - Execute the run script:
     ```bash
     .\run.bat
     ```

4. **View Output**
   - Check the terminal or command prompt for any output or errors generated by the script.

5. **Adjust as Necessary**
   - If there are errors, review the logs or console output for guidance on how to resolve them.
